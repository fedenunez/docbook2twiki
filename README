This project contains two XSL stylesheets that convert DocBook documents
(http://www.docbook.org/) to TWiki (http://www.twiki.org/) and
Confluence Wiki (http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/).

This project was started soon after I finished the DocBook exporter (see
http://code.google.com/p/bcui-emacs) for Emacs Org-mode
(http://orgmode.org/).  Since I used TWiki at work, I had been hoping
that I could export text files written in Org-mode into TWiki format
using DocBook format as a bridge, assuming that somebody already wrote a
stylesheet that converts DocBook documents to TWiki format.  However, I
failed to find such a stylesheet after several hours of searching...

The stylesheet for Confluence Wiki was added later after I switched to a
new company.

Because DocBook contains more features than TWiki or Confluence Wiki
does, the stylesheets only (and will always) support a subset of DocBook
elements.  However most of the formatting features supported in Emacs
Org-mode are supported here.

This directory contains:
