This is an XSL stylesheet that converts DocBook documents
(http://www.docbook.org/) to TWiki (http://www.twiki.org/) format.

This project was started soon after I finished the DocBook exporter (see
http://code.google.com/p/bcui-emacs) for Emacs Org-mode
(http://orgmode.org/).  Since I use TWiki at work, I have been hoping
that I can export text files written in Org-mode into TWiki format using
DocBook format as a bridge, assuming that somebody already wrote a
stylesheet that converts DocBook documents to TWiki format.  However, I
failed to find such a stylesheet after several hours of searching...

This stylesheet is far from complete, but most of the formatting
features supported in Org-mode are supported here.

This directory contains:

  README

      using ``Org-mode DocBook exporter + docbook2twiki.xsl.''

      Org file used for testing.
  
  test.twiki
      TWiki file converted from test.xml using docbook2twiki.xsl.

  test.xml

If you have any comments on how to improve this stylesheet, please send
